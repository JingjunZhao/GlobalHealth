However, we filtered out the data to focus on 2017. "),
  h2("Findings"),
  p("Overall, the data we used allowed us to answer our research questions. We could see which countries were in debt, and from there, we were able to look at the exact percentages of government expenditure that went to health care in a year. From the global map chart, the gap in the percentage of health spending is serious and clear, southern countries and especially African countries had low health-related expenditure and a low health spending percentage in terms of government expenditure (less than ten percent), as they are in a lighter color. And the majority of them have and some of them even have close to zero percent, which is significantly insufficient for their citizens to enjoy a well-being health system. The negative correlation between the spending percentage of health expenditure and international debt can be proved through the second chart: the majority of countries that are facing debt crises from both private and public debts have lower spending in health-related policy and facilitation. In comparison, countries with no debt or even have a positive amount of debt, the creditors, are more general in terms of health-related expenditure. The harm caused by low spending is conspicuous: limited money means limited resources and a limited workforce, which leads to an unhealthy population. Using the maternal mortality rate as a health indicator, we can clearly see the seriousness of health inequality and the terrible effects because of the insufficient government input. Countries like Colombia have a mortality rate as high as 50 percent and other African countries also have rates around 30 percent, which is some horrible data to process and imagine and help us to realize the essential effect brought by international debts. Whereas countries like Japan, which has the highest percentage of government expenditure spending on health, has a 0.005 percent of maternal mortality rate. Of course, there are many other causes that led to this result, other than government health spending and health inequality, but the significant trends and data should prove that debt is one of the major causes leading to health inequality."),
  p("As a short conclusion, from this project, we can certainly testify to our initial hypothesis that there is an important correlation between international debts and health inequality, that the more a country owed, the more likely the country had poor medical conditions. We are sure once we build this correlation, more people would notice and understand the harm caused by international debts, as a key contributor to health inequality, and would be more likely to resolve it."),
  h2("Discussion"),
  p("Besides the correlation between debts and health conditions and the well-bings of the countries’ citizens, the project further proves the existence and harm of austerity policies, which refers to a system of economic regulations that a government enacts to manage the debt of the public sector. When a country's public debt is too high and default or being unable to make due payments on its debts is a serious possibility, the government implements austerity measures. Our project proves the potential but harmful effects of the vague word “austerity”. In this situation and such policy, not only health expenditure, sectors like education, retirement pension, and other social welfare would also face serious cuts and further lead to greater social harms and unhealthy situations. Even though this specific project only addressed health-related data and inequality, the serious effect of austerity on health pointed out by our project can essentially indicate its harm to these other sections, which are also significant factors to decide world inequality and citizens' life expectations.  Under this finding, we sure need to understand the harm of austerity and international debt; in addition, actions are needed to promote all kinds of debt relief, and that is actually what many world health organizations begin to do, especially under the outbreak of Covid-19, where the majority countries are facing their economic downsides and in increasing need of health equipment, medicines, and workforce. In light of the pandemic, these countries' pressure on both repaying the bills and taking care of their citizens was dramatized, and the inequality situation was even harsher."),
  p("In response, more world organizations realized it and provide additional help to the countries to handle the overwhelming effects brought by COVID. World Bank has given out loans to help especially for the Global South to repay the bills, and G20 launched Debt Service Suspension Initiative to delay the debt without additional interest to lessen the government pressure. In addition, the UHC (universal health coverage) set up a goal with actually assistant to bring health to anywhere in the world including financial risk protection, access to quality essential healthcare services, and so on to resolve the difficulties."),
  p("Our group wants to use this project to not only point out and testify to the correlation in between, but we want to use this opportunity to let everyone realize this specific reason causing global inequality. Only with more people understanding the effect and reason, we can better solve this question, and more actions and proposals can be done to ask these powerful institutions to make changes and improve inequality."),
  h2("Conclusion"),
  p("Healthcare isn’t only defined by the amount of nurses or doctors or the skills of these workers. Financial stability by the country is an important aspect that impacts the quality and availability of healthcare for the people. Unfortunately, there is a large financial gap between different different countries, specifically in the Global South. Certain areas such as Africa, Latin America, and other develpoping countries face economic instability that makes it difficult to fund something as important as proper healthcare facilities and workers. Through this project, we sought out to find a proper correlation between these two variables and determine the root cause of how government debt is impacting people’s health across the world."),
  p("Based on our findings, we were able to compare the financial aspect of global healthcare with an important indicator of health such as maternal mortalty. Our first chart measuring health spending as a share of governemnt expenditure led us to reach the conclusion that most African and southern countries experience low cost expenditures for healthcare (almost 0%) which consequently provides no access to sufficient health services to the public. Our second chart that specifically investigates government debt supports this notion by demonstrating the correlation that the majority of these countries that are spending less money on healthcare are also in debt both privately and publicly. Finally, we reflected these financial results into investigating real data of mortality ratios of maternal women across various countries. Based on our third graph, there was a strong indirect correlation between maternal mortality and government spending. In other words, our results found that less spending on healthcare and therefore increased debt in a country led to a higher mortality rate overall."),
  p("Countries in the Global South are suffering from insufficient healthcare services based on their governemnt’s lack of funding and financial stability. These developing countries already have limited resources which are contributing to the deteriorating health that’s present there. Factors such as limited access to clean water or poor air quality are already prevalent in these countries. The fact that little to no money is being spent on the healthcare system that is supposed to treat it just makes the situation worse for the people living in these conditions."),
  p("This project touches on only a small aspect of this issue but it’s nonetheless important. Millions of people are suffering around the world because of poor healthcare services stemming from their country’s increasing debt and lack of spending. It is vital to bring to light this economic instability the Global South faces and provide them with the proper healthcare and funding they deserve.")
